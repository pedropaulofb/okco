The open-world semantics, base for the main languages used in the semantic web, considers a scenario where not all domain knowledge is available for users. In such scenario, depending on the domain size, even with a knowledge structure provided by an OWL ontology, it is not possible for its user (a human or machine knowledge manager) to fully comprehend and understand how to complete the structure requirements with the missing information. OKCo – an OWL Ontology Knowledge Completer, allow users to discover and complete the required domain knowledge. OKCo is provided (i) as an interactive web application, for human user, (ii) as a web service, for human or machine users, and (iii) as a programming API. OKCo can be used as a stand-alone application or, most importantly, as basis for a generic framework for development of ontology-based intelligent applications. OKCo’s structure and functionalities are here presented with examples.
